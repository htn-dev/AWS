**GOAL:**

Migrating the Caf√© web application to use a fully managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance instead of a local database instance.


_ Create an Amazon RDS MariaDB instance using the AWS CLI.

_ Migrate data from a local MariaDB database to an Amazon RDS MariaDB database.

_ Monitor an Amazon RDS instance using Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

**
Migrating to Amazon RDS** eliminates the burden of manually performing common database maintenance tasks, such as backups, patch installation, and upgrades. As a fully managed service, Amazon RDS performs these tasks automatically.
