**GOAL:**

Migrating the Caf√© web application to use a fully managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance instead of a local database instance.


_ Create an Amazon RDS MariaDB instance using the AWS CLI.

_ Migrate data from a local MariaDB database to an Amazon RDS MariaDB database.

_ Monitor an Amazon RDS instance using Amazon CloudWatch metrics.


The administration of database can be a burden. Doing weekly database backups requires employees to work extra hours on weekends because they must manually submit the backup job. They must also verify it successfully runs during the hours when the business is closed.

In addition, Installing a required patch can be struggling and waste more time.

Business' labor costs can be increased because they must pay for the overtime hours.

Migrating to Amazon RDS eliminates the burden of manually performing common database maintenance tasks, such as backups, patch installation, and upgrades. As a fully managed service, Amazon RDS performs these tasks automatically.
