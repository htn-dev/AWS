In this lab, we will create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline using
AWS, and then use that pipeline to deploy a new version of our website automatically.
We'll implement this with AWS CodeStar, a frontend tool that will automatically
configure AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline.
By the end of the lab, you should understand what a CI/CD pipeline is, as well as the
basics of how to set one up and push an update to a source code repository to trigger a
new deploy
