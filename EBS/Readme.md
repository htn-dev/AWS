Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) offers persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. 
Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance. 
Amazon EBS volumes are highly available, highly reliable volumes that can be leveraged as an Amazon EC2 instances boot partition 
or attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance as a standard block device.

Create an Amazon EBS volume, attach it to an instance, apply a file system to the volume, and then take a snapshot backup.
